# Our research
The long-term goals of our research are to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of human diseases, especially neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disease, using innovative genomics and cell biology technologies. Our lab also develops new CRISPR-based functional genomics tools to facilitate our biomedical research. We are best known for creating genome-wide modifier screens of disease-relevant cell biology to uncover disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic strategies. Our group integrates functional studies in biology (cell survival, proliferation, calcium-dependent signaling pathways and morphological phenotypes) and high throughput approaches (RNA-Seq, scRNA-seq, CROP-seq)to study biological mechanisms and to improve  molecular mechanism on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases discovery. Group members move fluidly between computation and experiment, often inventing new methods to answer their questions. 

#### We work on different human iPSC-derived cells in the brain and performed CRISPR-based functional genomics technology, to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms of human neurological diseases: as hits get less, functional screens become easier... until the hits get too certified... and then their potential mechanisms begin to reveal themselves and the fun challenges begin.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of human neurological diseases

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

Tian et al. presented a CRISPR interference-based platform for genetic screens in human iPSC-derived neurons in the previous [research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.07.014). This platform enables systematic elucidation of gene function in human neurons and reveals neuron-specific roles of genes for survival, transcriptomics states, and morphology.

### CRISPR-based functional genomics technology development in the brain

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

We developed [website](http://www.crisprbrain.org/) to discover the data commons for functional genomics screens in differentiated human cell types. Such screens can query a large set of genes (such as all ~20,000 protein-coding human genes) for their contribution to a cellular function of interest. These provide an overview of different modes of screening and highlights examples of recent CRISPR screens with relevance to neurological disease.
