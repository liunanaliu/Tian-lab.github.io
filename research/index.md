# Our research
The long-term goals of our research are to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of human diseases, especially neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disease, using innovative genomics and cell biology technologies. Our lab also develops new CRISPR-based functional genomics tools to facilitate our biomedical research. We are best known for creating genome-wide modifier screens of disease-relevant cell biology to uncover disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic strategies. Our group integrates functional studies in biology (cell survival, proliferation, calcium-dependent signaling pathways and morphological phenotypes) and high throughput approaches (RNA-Seq, scRNA-seq, CROP-seq)to study biological mechanisms and to improve  molecular mechanism on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases discovery. Group members move fluidly between computation and experiment, often inventing new methods to answer their questions. 

#### We work on different human iPSC-derived cells in the brain and performed CRISPR-based functional genomics technology, to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms of human neurological diseases: as hits get less, functional screens become easier... until the hits get too certified... and then their potential mechanisms begin to reveal themselves and the fun challenges begin.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of human neurological diseases

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

We study proteins as conformational ensembles.
Although X-ray crystallography is an ensemble experiment, the results are typically summarized with a single static structure.
We developed [website](http://www.crisprbrain.org/) to discover the data commons for functional genomics screens in differentiated human cell types
The ensemble nature of proteins highlighted by this work feeds into all of our mechanistic studies that interpret the functional effects of mutations, that characterize designed and artificially-evolved proteins, or that seek to modulate protein function with small molecules.
These methods development efforts are central to discovering new allosteric ligands, through high throughput crystallographic fragment screening efforts.
We are expanding, this direction to include modeling and validating protein structural data generated by cryoelectron microscopy (using EMRinger and ensemble modeling) and through integrative approaches to discover cryptic ligand binding sites. 
These methods development efforts are central to discovering new allosteric ligands, through high throughput crystallographic fragment screening efforts.
