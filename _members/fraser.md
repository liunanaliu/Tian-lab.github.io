description: "Ruilin was an undergraduate at Peking University, and he worked in the Ouyang laboratory.

He started in 2015 to do his Ph.D. in [University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA](https://kampmannlab.ucsf.edu/ruilin-tian-phd).
There, he worked with [Dr. Martin Kampmann](https://kampmannlab.ucsf.edu/welcome-kampmann-lab) creating  biophysical methods to develop [CRISPR-based functional genomics platforms in human iPSC-derived neurons](/publications#17573816).
They applied these techniques to study [Uncovered genes regulating neuronal redox homeostasis and oxidative stress response through genome-wide CRISPR screens](/publications#19956261).

After that, he continued his postdoc training in Martinâ€™s lab.


In the end of 2020, Ruilin was appointed as an [assistant professor at SUSTech Fellow](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/tianruilin.html?lang=en).
